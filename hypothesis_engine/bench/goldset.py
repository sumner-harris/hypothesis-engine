"""Gold-set scoring for the bench.

A GoldSet is a list of canonical entities (drugs, gene targets, mechanisms,
…) each with optional aliases. After a candidate produces hypotheses we ask:
**which entities did it actually surface?** That gives a per-candidate
recall against a curated answer key, alongside the head-to-head Elo from
the cross-tournament.

Match semantics:
- Case-insensitive whole-word match. We Unicode-normalize, split into
  alphanumeric tokens, then check whether the entity's tokens appear as
  a contiguous subsequence (so "binimetinib" matches but "binimet" or
  "binimetinib_X" do not).
- Searched fields per hypothesis: title, summary, full_text, and every
  string in `entities` and `citations[].title`/`excerpt`.
- An entity counts as a hit if *any* of its (canonical name + aliases)
  matches in *any* searched field of *any* of the candidate's hypotheses.

Why not regex with `\\b`? Because biology and pharma names mix dashes,
slashes, and Greek letters that punish naive `\\b` matching. The token
approach is robust to "PI3K-Akt", "dimethyl-fumarate", "TGF-β", etc.
