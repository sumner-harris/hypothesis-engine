"""Model bench: cross-tournament comparison of LLM providers / models.

Given one research goal and a list of `(label, provider, model)` candidates,
the bench:

1. Runs Generation N times for each candidate under a per-candidate Config
   override (its own provider + model + API key resolution).
2. Drops all produced hypotheses into a single round-robin Elo tournament
   judged by ONE fixed `judge_provider` / `judge_model` so the comparison
   is fair (no echo-judge bias and no per-side judge drift).
3. Aggregates per-candidate stats: mean Elo, top Elo, win-rate, $/hyp,
   latency, dollars spent.
4. Persists everything to bench_runs / bench_candidates / bench_matches
   and writes a JSON artifact summary.

This is a *separate* code path from Supervisor / sessions — bench runs do
NOT create a `sessions` row, do NOT enter the main task queue, and do NOT
share Elo state with regular sessions. They reuse the underlying
GenerationAgent and the Elo math.
